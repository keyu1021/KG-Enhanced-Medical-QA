# KG-Enhanced-Medical-QA
COMP545 Final Project


## Description
This project integrates a knowledge graph into a question-answering system leveraging a fine-tuned language model. It utilizes a comprehensive dataset of medical knowledge encompassing diseases, drugs and their interrelationships etc. The original data for this project is obtained from Harvar Dataverse: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IXA7BM

## Graph Database
